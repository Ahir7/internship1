###WEEK 1:
During the week from 13/05/2024 to 18/05/2024, I, Harsh Ahir, focused on enhancing my understanding and skills in the .NET framework as part of my work on the SD-WAN project. My efforts began with studying the .NET framework in-depth, exploring its various components and functionalities essential for developing robust applications. I then applied this knowledge by building console applications in C#, which helped me practice writing and executing basic programs in the language. Additionally, I ventured into web development using Blazor, a framework for creating interactive web user interfaces with .NET. This hands-on experience involved developing web applications, allowing me to explore Blazor's capabilities in building dynamic and responsive web apps. Overall, this week was marked by significant learning and practical application, which has laid a solid foundation for my ongoing work on the SD-WAN project.

###WEEK 2:
During the week from 20/05/2024 to 25/05/2024, I, focused on several key aspects of the SD-WAN project. My work began with understanding the OpenFlow protocol, which is critical for controlling network switches and shaping the flow of network traffic. I also configured networks using Mikrotik RouterOS, gaining practical experience in setting up and managing network devices. Additionally, I explored the application of OpenFlow control in C#, developing a console application to manage switches using this protocol. This hands-on work with OpenFlow and network configuration significantly enhanced my knowledge and skills, contributing to the development of a robust SD-WAN solution.

###WEEK 3:
During the week from 27/05/2024 to 01/06/2024, my focus shifted to more advanced topics in the SD-WAN project. I applied the Dijkstra Algorithm to find the best paths within the network, optimizing the routing process. I also studied the WireGuard protocol, a modern VPN protocol known for its simplicity and high performance. Furthermore, I worked on creating a server-to-edge nodes cross-site VPN, establishing secure and efficient communication channels across different network segments. This week involved in-depth algorithmic work and practical implementation, further advancing the project's objectives.

###WEEK 4:
During the week of 09/06/2024 to  15/06/2024, the SD-WAN project made significant strides with the successfull implementation of SD-WAN using the Openflow protocol and OpenDaylight Controller, which involved setting up and configuring essential infrastructure. Additionally, virtual labs were established to simulate the entire SD-WAN process, providing a controlled environment for testing and validation to ensure all components functioned correctly before live deployment. This simulation helped identify and address potential issues, enhancing the project's reliability. Furthermore, a REST-API was applied to enable seamless communication with the SDN Controller, supporting automation and improving network management efficiency.
